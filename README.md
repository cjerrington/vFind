# vFind

Simple Python script to browse for your lost virtual environments when working on Python projects.

This script will scan a source directory and output the virtual environments it finds based on a pattern its looking for. 

## Usage

Run `python vfind.py -s "/path/to/look/in"` and once complete you should see the output in a nice table for you to review. 

In the table I also show the folder size of the project. Some virtual environments can get a bit large due to the copying of Python runtimes and new site-packages for the installed pip modules. 

Please feel free to run, test, enjoy and update here as needed. 

Let me know if there are any updates or improvements we can use.
